# GPTune

*GPTune* is an autotuning framework that relies on multitask and transfer learnings to help solve the underlying black-box optimization problem.
GPTune is part of the xSDK4ECP effort supported by the Exascale Computing Project (ECP).

## Dependency
GPTune relies on OpenMPI (4.0 or higher), Python (3.7 or higher), BLAS/LAPACK, SCALAPACK (2.1.0 or higher), mpi4py, scikit-optimize and autotune, which need to be installed by the user. In what follows, we assume OpenMPI, Python, BLAS/LAPACK have been installed (with the same compiler version):
```
export MPICC=path-to-c-compiler-wrapper
export MPICXX=path-to-cxx-compiler-wrapper
export MPIF90=path-to-f90-compiler-wrapper
export MPIRUN=path-to-mpirun
export BLAS_LIB=path-to-blas-lib
export LAPACK_LIB=path-to-lapack-lib
export GPTUNEROOT=path-to-gptune-root-directory
```

The rest can be installed as follows:


## Install SCALAPACK
```
cd $GPTUNEROOT
wget http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/scalapack-2.1.0.tgz
tar -xf scalapack-2.1.0.tgz
cd scalapack-2.1.0
rm -rf build
mkdir -p build
cd build
mkdir -p install
cmake .. \
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=$MPICC \
    -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=$MPIF90 \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./install \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON \
    -DCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS="-fopenmp" \
    -DBLAS_LIBRARIES="$BLAS_LIB" \
    -DLAPACK_LIBRARIES="$LAPACK_LIB"
make 
make install
export SCALAPACK_LIB="$PWD/install/lib/libscalapack.so"  
```


## Install mpi4py
```
cd $GPTUNEROOT
git clone https://github.com/mpi4py/mpi4py.git
cd mpi4py/
python setup.py build --mpicc="$MPICC -shared"
python setup.py install --user
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD
```

## Install scikit-optimize
```
cd $GPTUNEROOT
git clone https://github.com/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize.git
cd scikit-optimize/
pip install --user -e .
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD
```

## Install autotune
autotune contains a common autotuning interface used by GPTune and ytopt. It can be installed as follows:
```
cd $GPTUNEROOT
git clone https://github.com/ytopt-team/autotune.git
cd autotune/
pip install --user -e .
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD
```

## Install GPTune
GPTune also depends on several external Python libraries as listed in the `requirements.txt` file, including numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, pyaml, matplotlib, GPy, openturns,lhsmdu, ipyparallel, opentuner, hpbandster, and pygmo. These Python libraries can all be installed through the standard Python repository through the pip tool.
```
cd $GPTUNEROOT
env CC=$MPICC pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```

In addition, the following MPI-enabled component needs to be installed:
```
cd $GPTUNEROOT
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. \
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$MPICXX \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=$MPICC \
    -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=$MPIF90 \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON \
    -DTPL_BLAS_LIBRARIES="$BLAS_LIB" \
    -DTPL_LAPACK_LIBRARIES="$LAPACK_LIB" \
    -DTPL_SCALAPACK_LIBRARIES=$SCALAPACK_LIB
make 
cp lib_gptuneclcm.so ../.
```

## Examples
There are a few examples included in GPTune
### demo
The file `demo.py` in the `examples` folder shows how to describe the autotuning problem for a sequential objective function and how to invoke GPTune 
```
cd $GPTUNEROOT/examples
$MPIRUN -n 1 python ./demo.py
```
### SCALAPCK QR
The files `scalapack_*.py` in the `examples` folder shows how to tune the parallel QR factorization subroutine PDGEQRF with different features of GPTune. 
```
cd $GPTUNEROOT/examples
cp ../build/pdqrdriver ../.
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD/scalapack-driver/spt/
$MPIRUN -n 1  python ./scalapack_MLA.py -mmax 1000 -nmax 1000 -nodes 1 -cores 4 -nprocmin_pernode 1 -ntask 2 -nrun 20 -machine yourmachine -optimization 'GPTune'
```
### SuperLU_DIST
First, SuperLU_DIST needs to be installed with the same OpenMPI and BLAS/LAPACK as the above.
```
cd $GPTUNEROOT/examples
git clone https://github.com/xiaoyeli/superlu_dist.git
cd superlu_dist
wget http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/fetch/sw/parmetis/parmetis-4.0.3.tar.gz
tar -xf parmetis-4.0.3.tar.gz
cd parmetis-4.0.3/
mkdir -p install
make config shared=1 cc=$MPICC cxx=$MPICXX prefix=$PWD/install
make install 
cd ../
export PARMETIS_INCLUDE_DIRS="$PWD/parmetis-4.0.3/metis/include;$PWD/parmetis-4.0.3/install/include"
export PARMETIS_LIBRARIES=$PWD/parmetis-4.0.3/install/lib/libparmetis.so
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-Ofast -std=c++11 -DAdd_ -DRELEASE" \
    -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-std=c11 -DPRNTlevel=0 -DPROFlevel=0 -DDEBUGlevel=0" \
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$MPICXX \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=$MPICC \
    -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=$MPIF90 \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON \
    -DTPL_BLAS_LIBRARIES="$BLAS_LIB" \
    -DTPL_LAPACK_LIBRARIES="$LAPACK_LIB" \
    -DTPL_PARMETIS_INCLUDE_DIRS=$PARMETIS_INCLUDE_DIRS \
    -DTPL_PARMETIS_LIBRARIES=$PARMETIS_LIBRARIES
make pddrive_spawn 
```
Note that `pddrive_spawn` is a modified application driver that will be launched by GPTune via MPI spawning (see the Usage section). The files `superlu_*.py` in the `examples` folder shows how to tune the performance of sparse LU factorization with different features of GPTune. 
```
cd $GPTUNEROOT/examples
$MPIRUN -n 1 python ./superlu_MLA_MO.py  -nodes 1 -cores 4 -nprocmin_pernode 1 -ntask 1 -nrun 10 -machine youmachine -optimization 'GPTune'
```


## Usage

### Problem description

#### Spaces

In order to autotune a certain application, three spaces have to be defined through an instance of the **Space** class.
1. Input Space (IS): this space defines the problems that the application targets.
Every point in this space represents one instance of a problem.
In the context of GPTune, the word *task* means application *problem*.
2. Parameter Space (PS): this space defines the application parameters to be tuned.
A point in this space represents a combination of the parameters.
The goal of the tuner is to find the best possible combination that minimizes the objective function of the application.
3. Output Space (OS): this space defines the result(s) of the application, i.e., the objective of the application to be optimized.
For examples, this can be runtime, memory or energy consumption in HPC applications or prediction accuracy in machine learning applications.

#### Parameters

Every dimension of the above mentioned spaces is defined by a **Parameter** object.
Every parameter i defined by its name, type and range or set of values.
Three types of parameters can be defined:
1. Real: defines floating point parameters.
The range of values that the parameter spans should be defined in the *range* argument.
2. Integer: defines integer parameters.
The range of values that the parameter spans should be defined in the *range* argument.
3. Categorical: defines parameters that take their values in a set or list of values.
The list of valid values defining the parameter should be defined in the *values* argument.

**_Note_**
```
If the problems the application targets cannot be defined in a cartesian space, the user can simply give a list of problems (as a Categorical parameter) in the definition of the task space.
```
#### Constraints

Not all points in the task or input spaces correspond to valid problems or parameter configurations.
Constraints might exist that define the validity of a given combination of input parameters and problem description parameters results.
Two ways exist to define constraints in GPTune:
1. Strings: the user can define a Python statement in a string.
The evaluation of that statement should be a boolean.
2. Functions: the user can define a Python function that returns a boolean. 

#### Objective Function
The user need to define a Python function representing the objective function to be optimized
```
def objectives(point)
   # extract the parameters from 'point', invoke the application code, and store the objective function value in 'result'
   return result
```
Here point is a dictionary containing key pairs representing task and tuning parameters. If the application code is distributed-memory parallel, the user needs to modify the application code (in C, C++, Fortran, Python, etc.) with the MPI spawning syntax and invoke the code using MPI.COMM_SELF.Spawn from mpi4py. Please refer to the user guide for details https://github.com/gptune/GPTune/blob/master/Doc/GPTune_UsersGuide.pdf.   

#### Performance Models

The user having additional knowledge about the application can help speed up or improve the result of the tuning process by passing a performance model(s) of the objective function to be optimized.

These models are defined through Python functions following similarly to the constraints definition.

### GPTune invocation

Once the parameters and spaces (and optionally constraints and models) are defined, an object of the **GPTune** class has to be instantiated.
Then, the different kinds of tuning techniques (*MLA, ...*) can be called through it.
